### Style Transfer using CNN and VGG16 Architecture

#### Dependencies

- `python3`
- `scipy`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow` / `tensorflow-gpu`
- `pillow`
- `numpy`


#### Usage

- You can run using the accompanying IPython notebooks in [Work/notebook]() folder
- Or you can run [Work/py_scripts/style_transfer.py]() like

```bash
python style_transfer.py path/to/style/image path/to/content/image
```

**Note that outputs will be faster on a machine with CUDA supported Nvidia GPU** 

- From naming - style image supplies the style to be applied on a content or 
a target image
